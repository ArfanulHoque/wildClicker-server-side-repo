    "description": "Gorilla trekking to photograph mountain gorillas is certainly a “huge tick” for most wildlife photographers. On this photo safari, you will do two gorilla treks as well as spend a day in the company of a troop of chimpanzees guided by one of the top primate photography specialists in the world – Nelis Wolmarans.Some may say safari trips are best done in the summer, but for me, October and November are beautiful times to be in Gir National Park. This is the time when the park has just reopened from the monsoon break, and the dry arid landscape has been replaced by green grasses and lush vegetation. Not only does this make a beautiful background for wildlife photographs, but it is also a staple for the herbivores of Gir, such as Spotted Deer, Sambar, and Nilgai, and young fawns are seen with their parents."

    "description": "In 2021 we added the amazing Central Kalahari to our other iconic photographic destinations – The Chobe and Okavango Delta – for a 10-day hosted wildlife photo safari. Led by one of our resident photo hosts you will spend three nights in each destination photographing in a group of no more than eight guests. Starting on The Pangolin Voyager Houseboat, on The Chobe River, you will then fly into the Okavango Delta for some more land-based photography in this incredible photo safari destination and World Heritage Site.India is the only country in the world that can claim both Lion and Tiger among its native fauna. While many tours take you to see Tigers, this Wildlife Tour of Gujarat is unique in its focus on Asiatic Lions in the Gir Forest. The beautiful Blackbuck in the Velavadar Reserve and endangered Asiatic Wild Ass at Dasada Sanctuary are the other two main highlights of this trip.This trip starts as we fly to Ahmedabad and drive 2½ hours from the airport directly to Dasada. With the drive made as comfortable as possible by the well-trained driver, you will reach Dasada fresh enough to take the evening safari in the bleak salt marshy areas of Little Rann of Kutch. Though a bleak landscape, it is rich in biodiversity and is an ecologically important area for wildlife and many local and migratory waterbirds."
